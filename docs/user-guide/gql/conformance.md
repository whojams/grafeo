| FILTER passes only TRUE (not UNKNOWN) | Supported |
| IS NULL / IS NOT NULL for explicit checks | Supported |
| NULL handling in aggregates (ignored except count(*)) | Supported |

## Known Deviations from Standard

1. **Predicate desugaring**: IS DIRECTED, IS LABELED, IS SOURCE/DESTINATION OF are parsed and
   internally converted to function calls (isDirected(), hasLabel(), etc.) rather than being
   preserved as first-class predicate AST nodes. Semantics are equivalent.

2. **KEEP clause representation**: The standard specifies `KEEP <path pattern prefix>` wrapping
   all patterns. Grafeo implements KEEP as a per-pattern match mode flag, which is simpler but
   semantically equivalent.

3. **Variable scope validation**: The standard defines degree-of-exposure categories (unconditional
   singleton, conditional singleton, etc.) at parse time. Grafeo defers variable scope validation
   to execution time.

4. **Simplified path patterns**: The `-/:Label/->` shorthand is desugared to `-[:Label]->` at parse
   time. Both forms are semantically equivalent.
