//! Graph model implementations.
//!
//! Pick your graph model:
//!
//! | Model | When to use | Example use case |
//! | ----- | ----------- | ---------------- |
//! | [`lpg`] | Most apps (default) | Social networks, fraud detection |
//! | [`compact`] | Read-heavy / embedded (feature-gated: `compact-store`) | WASM, edge workers, static snapshots |
//! | [`rdf`] | Knowledge graphs | Ontologies, linked data (feature-gated) |
//!
//! These are separate implementations with no abstraction overhead - you get
//! the full performance of whichever model you choose.
