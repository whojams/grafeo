//! The complete query processing pipeline.
//!
//! Your query goes through several stages before results come back:
//!
//! 1. **Translator** - Parses GQL/Cypher/SPARQL into a logical plan
//! 2. **Binder** - Validates that variables and properties exist
//! 3. **Optimizer** - Pushes filters down, reorders joins for speed
//! 4. **Planner** - Converts the logical plan to physical operators
//! 5. **Executor** - Actually runs the operators and streams results
//!
//! Most users don't interact with these directly - just call
//! [`Session::execute()`](crate::Session::execute). But if you're building
//! custom query processing, [`QueryProcessor`] is the unified interface.
