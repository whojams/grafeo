Grafeo supports multiple storage modes for different use cases.

## Storage Modes

|------|------------|-------------|----------|
| In-Memory | None | Fastest | Testing, temporary data |
| Persistent | Full | Fast | Production workloads |
| [Compact](../compact-store.md) | None (in-memory) | Fastest reads | Read-only analytics, WASM |
